# new1-demo

This is demo for Git &amp; GitHub Class for new1-demo repository.
A repository (or repo) is a central location where all the files related to a project are stored. 
            
#It also tracks the history of changes made to these files. Think of it as a project's folder that,    
Git manages to keep everything organized and version-controlled.                                    
                                                                    
I'm happy to connect with you.

 Independent from H/W and software                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 It's Dependent H/w & Os.

hoisting is the process.and phenomena it provides the concept to run before the decalartion.  
console.log(jUser.hasOwnProperty('fullName'));
    
a. Pre-increment;     
b. Post-increment;

let val = null ?? 5 ?? 10;
Object.create // singleton, constructor

Call Back Hell Three Things for coding.
to resolve this problem we inntroduce a concept Promises:

project()
two types of js hooksðŸ§·ðŸ§·ðŸ§·

const jUser ={
  "name": "nikku",
   dob:20-01-20224
}

property Acess method ()
text[0]

with the using of java script  we change html this is two step process
ðŸª¥ðŸª¥ðŸª¥ðŸª¥
the object()

document object
Application Layer

star topology
bus topology 

toFixed()
useState()

djdnsdjn
foreach((item, index, arr)=>
)

trastitive dependecies
const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getmElmentById("root"));

bundling

.parcel . webpack .veet
array destructuing 

object for in 
java for jsx

call dusre function as a argument or as aparameter liay ajata hai
there is lots of option()
useEffects()

#git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git add

#git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com",
for seeing there execution we using log. then we can see how its exwcute.

style={
  {backgroundcolor:"yellow"}
}

function() {
api.createFolder(cponsole.log());
}

relist.map(restaurent, index) => (
)

ui is basically controlling your ui how the ui looks live using data using a config 
and where that config comes from that config comes from backend.

root.render()

string to number conversion is create confusion.
we have many option to injected one compoent to others . using simple methods

root.render(</Heading>);


it is java scroipt peoce of code which is writen by the facebook developers
string
number

boolean

undefine 
null
primitive data type

<Restaurent cuisins=""/>
 jsx is like hmtl this is not html.
start is reserved keyword for react start

immutable: strings are immutable when we apply any operantion on strings then old variable are same and it gives new strings.
<Fragment><Fragment/>

Verifying a JWT:

we different type of event. 
1. change event: it tracks complete changes like intial status to final status.
2. input event: it tracks each and every steps like and single activity.

git config --global user.email
jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Token is invalid or expired');
    
  } else {
    console.log('Token is valid', decoded);
  }
});

const dog = function(){
  return "woof!";
  <Restaurent res-add ="Bhilai"
   cusins ="pizza, burger"/>
};
git ls -a
URL Encoding/Decoding: Uses encodeURIComponent() and decodeURIComponent() to ensure safe transmission of data via URLs.

console.log(dog);

app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  user.name = req.body.name;


  The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production.
  Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at:
  
# Define Endpoints: Decide what functionality your API will provide and define the endpoints.
  . Set Up a Server: Use a framework (e.g., Express.js for Node.js) to create a server that handles requests and responses.
  . Handle Requests: Write code to handle each type of request (GET, POST, etc.) and interact with your data source.
  . Send Responses: Ensure your API sends back the appropriate status codes and data.

var maybeIterator = MAYBE_ITERATOR_SYMBOL && maybeIterable[MAYBE_ITERATOR_SYMBOL] || maybeIterable[FAUX_ITERATOR_SYMBOL];

    if (typeof maybeIterator === 'function') {
      return maybeIterator;
    }
    return null;
  }
  It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.
  Learn more about using const with objects in the chapter: JS Const.  

  // In DEV, calls to console.warn and console.error get replaced
  // by calls to these methods by a Babel plugin.
  //
  // In PROD (or in packages without access to React internals),
  // they are left as they are instead.

  # Powershell

  we use different command in powershell.
