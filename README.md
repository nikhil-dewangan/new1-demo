# new1-demo
This is demo for Git &amp; GitHub Class for new1-demo repository.
A repository (or repo) is a central location where all the files related to a project are stored. 

It also tracks the history of changes made to these files. Think of it as a project's folder that, 
Git manages to keep everything organized and version-controlled.

I'm happy to connect with you.

#git config --global user.name "Your Name"

#git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

string to number conversion is create confusion.

immutable: strings are immutable when we apply any operantion on strings then old variable are same and it gives new strings.

Verifying a JWT:

jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Token is invalid or expired');
    
  } else {
    console.log('Token is valid', decoded);
  }
});

const dog = function(){
  return "woof!";
};

console.log(dog);

app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  user.name = req.body.name;

# Define Endpoints: Decide what functionality your API will provide and define the endpoints.
  . Set Up a Server: Use a framework (e.g., Express.js for Node.js) to create a server that handles requests and responses.
  . Handle Requests: Write code to handle each type of request (GET, POST, etc.) and interact with your data source.
  . Send Responses: Ensure your API sends back the appropriate status codes and data.

var maybeIterator = MAYBE_ITERATOR_SYMBOL && maybeIterable[MAYBE_ITERATOR_SYMBOL] || maybeIterable[FAUX_ITERATOR_SYMBOL];

    if (typeof maybeIterator === 'function') {
      return maybeIterator;
    }
    return null;
  }
  It is a common practice to declare objects with the const keyword.
  Learn more about using const with objects in the chapter: JS Const.  

  // In DEV, calls to console.warn and console.error get replaced
  // by calls to these methods by a Babel plugin.
  //
  // In PROD (or in packages without access to React internals),
  // they are left as they are instead.
